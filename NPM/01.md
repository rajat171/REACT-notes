**why NPM:**
To get the code that has some functionality in it we install packages that are predefined or previously coded.

if i am going to use a third party code it will be kept in a folder. this folder is created using ``npm init`` command.
The `init` command creates a `package.json` file which has the information we have got
`"main":` contains entry point which is a file we can change the name of the file anytime.

`npm config` gives error but it suggests some commands which can be used to know the configuration of the `npm`.
